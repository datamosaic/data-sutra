Various modules provide different functionality and are\nencapsulated into modules to organize development on our end.\nHowever, you only have to worry about two things: how to add Data Sutra resources into your app and how to add your app into the Data Sutra framework. From there on it is all configuration.\nCreate a module\nIt is a good idea to put all of your code—relations, forms, fields,\nvalue lists, etc—in your own module instead of modifying or extending\none of ours.\n(Reminder from install instructions: it is also good practice to create your own database connection to store your apps data in instead of adding tables to one of our connections.)\nBesides keeping your code organized and away from ours, your own modules allow you to use your flavor of team sharing (SVN, GiT, Mercurial, etc) and upgrade Data Sutra independently of your code. If you want to live on the cutting edge, you can even hook up our modules to their respective open source SVN repositories and pull down changes as they are made (not recommended unless you’re on a project with us or you think breaking things is fun!).\nHow to create a module\n\nRight-click on the “All Solutions” node of the Servoy Explorer pane\nand “Create new solution”. You will go through a short wizard to\nname your solution/module.\nSet the solution type of your new module. Set this to Module.\nThis will allow your code to run in both smart and web client.\nAlternately you can choose smart or web client only settings.\n\nNaming conventions!\n\nSee Naming Conventions\n\nWhat/how you name your module isn’t really important except that it has\nto be a unique name within the activated set of modules comprising of\nData Sutra and your modules.\nWhere naming becomes important is that many of the names for objects\n(forms, relations, value lists, etc) your module contains also have to\nbe unique across—you guessed it—the activated set of modules comprising\nof Data Sutra and your modules.\nA simple way to avoid naming collisions is to prepend all of your object\nnames in a particular module with a unique identifier for that module.\nTo make it easy for you to remember the unique identifier for your\nmodule, put the identifier in the module name in CAPS.\nA quick glance at a Data Sutra module list shows it all working in\npractice:\n\nInclude Data Sutra resource module\nIncluding modules is a great way to share code across modules. Including\nthe Data Sutra resource module gives you quick access to the Data Sutra\nstyles, API, helper functions, etc—just like you created all that code\nin your own module.\nHow to include\n\nselect your module in the Solution Explorer\ngo to the properties pane\nselect the moduleNames property\nadd the module _ds_CODE_resources\n\n\nImportant considerations\nCyclical module inclusion is not allowed! So for example, after\nincluding a resource module in your module—don’t include your module in\nthat particular resource module.\nThis restriction impacts how you organize and structure solutions for\nthe most amount of flexibility and code reuse. As applications grow in\nsize, the more impact good structure has (or bad structure!).\nA couple of tips:\n\nA you develop more and more generic routines over time you should\nsplit those out into your own resource module so you can share them\nbetween your business modules.\n\nTypically, a single business module will include GUI layer stuff such\nas forms; model layer stuff such as entity methods, relations, value\nlists; business logic stuff in the form of various methods; and security\nstuff such as who can do what, when and where.\n\n\nIf you create another business module and you notice yourself\nduplicating any of those layers to get going with the new module\n(typically the model layer; ie. duplication of relations), also putting\nthat stuff in a resource module will allow you to use the same stuff in\nboth modules.\nYou can start to see that there is a method to the madness of the module\nlist that comes with Data Sutra. For the noob, don’t worry about it for\nnow and just put all your code in one module. With Data Sutra, the only\nmess you can make is restricted to your own module! (We get to deal with\nour own messes….)\nYour turn!\nServoy is a form-based development environment. Forms are your GUI\ncanvas where you add various UI and functional components. Additionally,\nyou can create and store methods at the form level. Methods at the form\nlevel “know” everything about the form without having to reference the\nform explicitly. For example, if a form is bound to a data source all\nyou have to do to reference a column in the data source is type the name\nof the column: var firstName = name_first.\nYour first form\nForms can be displayed as the top level page by either setting it as the\nstartup form of your app or navigating to a form with navigation code\n(or picking from the toolbar in smart client).\nIn Data Sutra, you assign your form to a navigation item in the\nNavigation Engine configuration pane. You also assign viewing\nprivileges in the Access and Control configuration pane to groups.\nForms as components\nForms can also be displayed on other forms via the tab panel component.\nIn this way, you can combine many forms together (and many levels\n“deep”) to build up a complex interface that looks like one page to the\nuser. We often use the term “form stack” to refer to all the forms that\nmake up one interface.\n\nForms and data binding\nForms can be bound to a data source. The most common data source is a\ntable in a SQL database. When forms have a data source, when you place\nfield components onto the form they can be assigned to the form’s data\nsource columns (or related columns). Forms and fields together are the\nbasic level of design-time data binding in Servoy.\nForms have a view property that you can set to one of the following:\nRecord view | List view | Table view. Record view shows one record at\na time while the other two views show the current collection of records\n(whatever is in the table with whatever searches you may or may not have\napplied).\n\nEvents and properties\nEvery object in Servoy has their own unique events and properties that\ndefined the behavior of that object.\nProperties are usually set at design-time and can be modified at runtime\nwith methods. Events are the hooks where you attach your methods.\nonShow and onRecordSelection are form events that we seem to use the\nmost.\nCode\nThere are a lot of places to store code at in Servoy: globals, scopes,\ntables, calculations, and forms.\nTypically, code stored at the form level is where your app’s heavy\nlifting is done. You may be validating a particular piece of data,\nguiding the user through a process of steps, munging together complex\ndata structures, etc. This kind of code can get messy (for good reasons)\nand usually has no use outside of what is being done right there.\nAs you develop code that is more abstract and reusable, store this code\nsomewhere besides on a form. For easy reference a scope (named global)\nis a good place. If your code functions as a business rule for your\ndata, store as a table method (and hook up to a table event so it is run\nno matter what else is happening).\nLastly, methods stored on your form can be easily attached to Data\nSutra’s action buttons in the Navigation engine. This frees you from\nhaving to create your own buttons on your forms to wire up common\nfunctionality. This helps keep your UX consistent across all your forms.\nAnd what action buttons do exist on a particular form are then\nautomatically assumed to be very form-specific functionality.\n\nUI\nIf you suck at making nice user interfaces, you’re hardly alone. Even\nfor really good designers, coming up with a new UI from scratch is a\nlaborious process. So…\nDON’T START YOUR UI FROM SCRATCH\nThe mere fact that your forms end up inside the Data Sutra layout\nmanager gives you a starting edge. However, there are a number of things\nyou can do when working with forms that will make the creative process\ngo easier.\n1. Use our grid theme\nSet the style of your forms to “DATASUTRA”. This gives you a style\nsheet for development that translates into specific style sheets for\neach smart client platform (Mac, Windows and Linux) as well as for the\nweb.\nIn addition to default styling for objects such as the form, comboboxes,\ntab panels, row background colors, etc—there are multiple style classes\nyou can choose from for objects such as labels and fields. A\nclick-through of the objects on one of our sample forms while keeping an\neye on the styleClass property will give you an idea of the options.\nStray from our style class options at your own risk! It’s a dangerous\nworld out there and who likes to think that hard? (Don’t touch that\ncolor picker…don’t do it!)\n2. Line !@#$ up you lazy bastard\nSeriously, why do I even have to say this. Because programmers are the\nonly people I know where I repeatedly find objects dumped on a screen in\nhaphazard fashion. It’s like we all grew up never having to clean our\nrooms. Or when we did, we threw everything in the closet.\nPlease don’t subject the rest of the world to your crap. Clean it up.\nMake sure objects align. Don’t make one field slightly bigger than\nanother. Don’t plunk a button down in the middle of the screen. Do your\nbest to hide the fact that you’re not a normal human being.\n3. Anchor elements\nWithin a form there are various sections and groups of components.\nMaking sure the various groups expand/contract and go where they’re\nsupposed to go when the window is resized is just good practice.\n4. Organize your data\nNot all data is created equal. So don’t go putting the year-end profit\ngoal field next to the first name field. Yes, I’m talking to you over\nthere.\nTake a look at one of the prior screenshots and notice how we’ve\norganized the data into the following buckets:\n\ndetail\ninformational\nmeta\nrelated\nsummary\n\n5. Choose a workflow focus for your form\nWe’ve also arranged the data types from top-left to bottom-right in\norder of most discrete to least discrete. This is the arrangement we\ntypically use for forms that handle CRUD types of interactions. Other\ntypes of interactions (dashboards, drill-down reporting) may have this\norder flipped: start with the most top-view data and end with a list of\nall the items (for example).\nDon’t try to implement multiple workflow focuses with one form. It’s\npretty hard to create something that is easy to use for both data entry\nand reporting. But you can trigger reports from a data entry screen. Or\nyou could drill down from a report to the details, change a data point\nand view the report again.\nFocus on one thing doesn’t mean don’t use the other things, just use the\nother things sparingly.\n6. Don’t start with a blank form\nDuplicate one of our forms. Sometimes it’s easier to cut stuff out than\nit is to add stuff in.\n7. Use our form tab panel controllers\n\nFor tab panels we don’t use the default tabs. This is accomplished by\nsetting the tabOrientation to HIDE and rolling our own tab\ncontroller via a combination of labels, naming conventions, and some\ndefault code.\nNow this one deserves a wiki page all its own but for now if take a look\nat one of our many examples, note that it all relies on the name of the\ntab panel and the names of the labels used at the controllers for the\ntab panel. Then it’s just one generic method attached to all of the tab\nlabels to make it work.\n8. Use our tab panel action buttons\n\nNotice that in the previous screen shot there was a + button at the\ntop of the tab panels for and action (new record) that is applied to\neach list in the tab panel. Now this is a special case to implement\nbecause the button itself is on the form the tab panel is one while the\nnew record action to be run are methods on the forms attached to the\ntab panels.\n\nOne way to do this would be to write a method on the parent form that\ncalled each of the sub-form methods based on what form is in which tab\nslot. We’ve gone a step further and have written a generic method that\nyou attach to the + button that looks for the method named “REC_new” on\nthe sub-forms and runs that method for whatever form is currently\nshowing in the tab panel.\nThis approach can even be used when you want the “wheel” action bottom\n(drop down list of actions) applied to a tab panel. The method attached\nto the “wheel” button calls methods by naming convention on the tab\npanel sub forms. The sub form specific methods are responsible for\nloading the popup menu list and running code when a list item is\nselected.\n\nThese pics show completely different sets of actions depending on which\ntab panel item is active.\n\nSummary\nCreating a good UI is not a function of how creative you are. Creating a\ngood UI is a function of applying engineering best practices to a design\nthat has already been created and tested.\nConnect your module to Data Sutra\nOnce you connect your module up with Data Sutra, all of Data Sutra’s\nsetup and configuration panes know all about your module.\nHow to connect your module to Data Sutra\n\nmake sure the main Data Sutra module is activated (__DATASUTRA__)\nin the Solution Explorer\nunder the Modules node, select the __datasutra_connector module\ngo to the properties pane\nselect the moduleNames property\nadd your module\nrestart smart client if you already have it open\n\nConfigure navigation\nData Sutra’s Navigation Engine configuration pane is the centerpiece\nof a Data Sutra application.\n\nBare minimum configuration\n\ncreate a new workspace\ncreate a navigation item\nassign a form from your module to Desktop > Workflow\n\nUniversal List\nTo enable our no-required-list to go with your form:\n\ncheck on Desktop > Use UL\ngo to the Lists tab and configure your lists\n\nFast find and Replace\nTo enable our default searching capabilities for your form:\n\ngo to the Find tab and configure fast find items\ngo to the Replace tab to configure power find and replace\nfunctionality\n\nWire in workflow actions\nTo hook your workflow methods up to our action buttons:\n\ngo the Actions tab and connect your methods up our Add and\nWheel buttons\nadd your reports to our Reports button\nconfigure quick filters that will show up on our Filters button\nturn on transaction mode for your form (default code already\nimplemented which you can override)\n\n\nConfigure security\nIf you have Access and Control (a configuration pane) turned on, you\nwill need to add your new workspace and associated navigation items to\nthe group privileges for a user to have access to your new app!\nHow to add to a group\n\nopen up the Access & Control configuration pane\ngo to Groups\non the Navigation tab, add your workspace (“navigation set”)\nrelogin\n\n\nSome final thoughts\nThe collaborative iterative process\nBecause you can so quickly put together a useful workflow with Data\nSutra, the iterative process involving input from your users and other\nstakeholders can be very collaborative.\nCode-test-code-test-deploy-test-spec-test-etc and so on can be done in\nsuch a way that everyone knows what is going on and can have a say.\nValue proposition\nOn the simple side, Data Sutra allows you to quickly setup navigation,\ncore functionality, and security for you forms. Advantages:\n\nfull application from the start of your coding process\na LOT of code you don’t have to write\neasy to reconfigure\nwon’t run into trouble as your application grows\n\nOn the complex side, you probably have noticed a bunch of advanced\noptions as you’ve perused the various configuration panes. SaaS setup,\nsecurity with workflow controls, custom record filtering, branding,\ncreate your own toolbars and sidebars—the list goes on and on.\nSo for all its easy of use, Data Sutra won’t limit your future\npossibilities.\nApproach comparison\nYou may have heard of or run into the “extend form” approach to\nframeworking with Servoy. Servoy’s ISV framework uses this approach for\nexample.\nThe basic idea is that when you create a form, instead of creating a\nblank form from scratch you “extend” a set of base forms. Your form then\nhas navigation, security and whatnot available right at your form level.\nThis differs from our approach in that we don’t add all that stuff to\nyour form. You add your stuff to our stuff instead. We feel our approach\nallows you to focus better on writing just the code for your business\nworkflow without being bothered with what the application framework does\nfor you. Of course within your own workflow form, you can split out\nfunctionality into various forms and extend those forms. So you get the\nbest of both approaches with Data Sutra.\n"},"quick-start/features-orientation.html":{"url":"quick-start/features-orientation.html","title":"Features Orientation","keywords":"","body":"Features Orientation\n\n\n\n\n"},"quick-start/layout-overview.html":{"url":"quick-start/layout-overview.html","title":"Layout Overview","keywords":"","body":"Layout Manager\n\n\nMain panes\nNavigation\nUniversal List\nList only\nCustom only\nList/custom hybrid\n\n\nWorkflow\n\n\nSpaces\nDescription\nResizing\nConfigure\nUser preferences\n\n\nToolbars\nDescription\nCreate your own\nConfiguration\nAccess and Control\n\n\nSidebars\nDescription\nControls\nCreate your own\nConfiguration\nAccess and Control\n\n\nControls\nUniversal List\nTransactions\n\n\n\n\n\nMain panes\nNavigation\nThe navigation pane lists all the applications and views for a\nparticular workspace. Multiple workspaces can be setup for a login and\naccess via the workspace button directly above the navigation pane.\n\nSee Navigation Engine for how to configure workspaces,\napplications and views.\nUniversal List\nThe Universal List pane is a “compliment” pane to the main workflow\npane. There are three ways you can configure this pane.\nList only\nA common use-case is to show a list of records controlling a detail\nrecord view in the main workflow pane.\nBecause this list view is so common, Data Sutra allows you to configure\nthis pane with lists without having to code specific list forms for\nevery detail view in your solution. Additionally, you can configure\nmultiple lists per workflow form. Multiple lists are accessed from a\ncontrol in the title area:\n\nSee Navigation Engine for how to configure lists.\nCustom only\nYou can also configure this pane to show any Servoy form. This is\nidentical to how you assign a form to the main workflow area.\nThis approach allows for highly customized layouts. Usage examples:\nsmall monthly calendar picker, summary information, small charts, google\nmaps, goals for the week, etc.\nList/custom hybrid\nYou can have the best of both worlds, universal lists and custom forms\nin this pane. When both are present, there is a control in the title\narea to switch between views:\n\nTo configure, assign universal lists as usual and then head over to\nactions > tabs to include additional views:\n\nSome ideas for this approach is universal lists augmented by custom\nworkflows (ex: customized search), views (tree view, calendar view), or\nsummary information (aggregate info for records in list).\nWorkflow\nThe workflow pane is the main focus point for interacting with data and\ngetting stuff done. The demo CRM module and our configuration panes\nprovide some examples (from simple to complex) to kickstart your\ncreativity in solving business workflows.\nSee Navigation Engine for how to assign a Servoy form to the\nworkflow area.\nSpaces\n\nDescription\nThe spaces control group allows the user to focus in on particular\npanes:\n\nstandard: shows navigation, universal list and workflow panes\nnavigation control: shows navigation and workflow panes\nlist control: shows universal list and workflow panes. great for\nmany column lists.\nlist: maximizes the list pane and automatically includes a link to\nthe workflow space on each record. great for many column lists.\nworkflow: maximizes the workflow pane\n\nResizing\nThe last button in the spaces control group shows/hides drag areas to\nadjust sizing for layout panes.\n\nConfigure\nThe Navigation Engine allows you to turn on/off which spaces are\navailable per navigation item: \n\nUser preferences\nAccess and Control allows you to set divider location\npreferences per login:\n\nToolbars\nDescription\n\nThis portion of the layout in the header area allows for solution-wide\nwidgets such as record navigation, weather, and runtime console (which\nall come pre-installed)\nSwitch between controllers with control group buttons on the right side.\nIf there is a drop-down detail pane associated with the toolbar, the\ncenter button will open and close the drop-down pane.\nCreate your own\nIt is easy to create your own toolbars as they are just Servoy forms.\nSome ideas: notifications, custom actions bars, timer, etc.\nConfiguration\nThere is a dedicated Data Sutra configuration pane for assigning\nregistering Servoy forms to the toolbar area. See Toolbars and\nSidebars.\nAccess and Control\nAccess and Control allows you to turn toolbars on/off per group.\nSidebars\n\nDescription\nThe sidebar pane can be opened/closed by the button in the right top\ncorner of the header section.\nSidebars are similar to toolbars in that this pane applied\nsolution-wide. However, instead of the limited functionality provided by\nwidgets (simple controls and notifications), sidebars can be complete\nworkflows. Example ideas: notes, activities, time tracking, shopping\ncart, etc.\nNote that sidebar workflows are differentiated from main workflows in\nthat they are not scoped to any particular workspace, application, or\nview. They are scoped to the solution and can be accessed from where\never a user is currently at. Taking this to the next level, sidebar\nworkflows can implement workflows that access multiple main workflows.\nExample: a notes sidebar with a tagging system linking a note to many\ndifferent tables and records in your solutions.

With\nthe exception of the new record control, each control can have many\nitems that are shown in a popup menu when clicked.\nEach control has a configuration tab in the Navigation Engine\nallowing for easy setup of each control. Some run your methods directly,\nsome are meta data driven.\nThere are two additional places to access the universal list controls.\nRight-click context menu on any row in the universal list:\n\nand in the toolbar:\n\nTransactions\n\nNew for Data Sutra 4.0, we have implemented transaction mode that can be\nconfigured for each view via the Navigation Engine. When turned\non, a control group in the top right of the header will show buttons for\nedit start, edit save, and edit cancel. You can either write your\nown code for these actions or leave the method assignments empty to run\nour default action for each button.\nThe default workflow for transactions is when edit start is clicked\n(or a new record created), we dim out and make un-clickable all the\npanes except the main workflow pane.

Combining modules allows you to build up entire\napplications from reusable components.\n\nModule concepts\nExtending core functionality\nSVN considerations\n\nWith a little forethought and planning you can also keep their ability\nto be maintained and upgraded intact even when used across many\napplications and client projects.\nConcepts\nUnderstanding how Servoy modules work is key to keeping functionality\norganized and reusable.\nChain of command\nCombining modules is accomplished by including modules in other modules.\n“Parent” modules “see” everything from their “child” modules and can\nreference objects from included modules.\nHowever, a child module does not see the parent module and cannot\ndirectly reference objects in the parent module. While a well designed\nmodule hierarchy should largely negate the need to reference objects out\nof visible scope, you can use “soft” references to get around scope\nlimitations.\n“Hard” reference:\n`forms.WEB_0F_page`\nEquivalent “soft” reference:\n`forms['WEB_0F_page']`\nChain rules\nCircular references are flagged as an error.\nA circular reference is when a child module includes its parent module.\nHistorically, circular references were allowed but Servoy 6 is quite a\nbit more strict about this.\nA module can have multiple parent modules.\nAs long as you don’t create a circular reference, you can include a\nmodule in many other other modules. This is a handy way to share common\nresources (relations, value lists, calculations, helper methods, etc)\nwith other modules.\nName spacing\nServoy requires that all objects and methods not associated with a form\nhave a unique name. This includes:\n\nglobal methods and variables\nforms\nrelations\nvalue lists\nmedia\ncalculations\n\nForm object and method names need only to be unique per form.\nModules DO NOT create a unique name space for their included objects and\nmethods. This makes it very easy to have duplicate names in your\nsolution after including a module.\nThis is a deficiency in how modules currently work and we’ve heard\nvarious rumblings over the years on plans to improve this aspect of\nmodules.\nUntil then, you are responsible for making sure you don’t have unique\nnames across modules.\nOur approach is to use naming conventions to enforce uniqueness. Each of\nour module names includes several characters in CAPS that make up a\nunique identifier for that module. We use this identifier as a prefix to\nall names inside that module.\nNote in this screen shot how the global methods and the form names have\nthe module identifier as a prefix:\n\nAt some point, it seems that just about every language or development\ntool requires the programmer to resort to naming conventions to enforce\norganization. Modules is where Servoy requires us to use naming\nconventions to get around their lack of name space functionality.\nAn organized application\nAn application that comprises of frameworks modules, resource modules,\nbusiness application modules, Sutra CMS modules, and various website\nspecific modules—can easily reach 25+ modules.\n\nThe trick to making modules work for you is to keep the focus of each\nmodule very specific and not coding similar functionality in multiple\nmodules. The following module breakdown is how we conceptualize modules:\n\nThe chain of included modules starts at the entry point module and\ngenerally goes down and to the right.\nA module must belong to one task grouping (application, business,\ngeneric, extend) and provide unique functionality within that task\ngroup. For example, we wouldn’t create a module for document management\nand navigation functionality. On the other hand, we would add FTP\nfunctionality to a document management module if it were limited to a\nfew methods but a full FTP client with a UI we would separate into its\nown module.\nThis approach to modules has worked very well for us over the years and\nprovides the right amount of structure to keep us from duplicating too\nmuch functionality and allow us to easily combine reusable modules into\nlarger solutions.\nExtending Core Functionality\nPerfect module organization only works if you have a plan for extending\ncore functional modules to adapt to specific project and client\nrequirements. Otherwise, inevitably you end up writing customizations\ndirectly into core functional modules which limits their reusability in\nthe future.\nHere are a number of approaches for extending modules:\n\nAddon modules  \nMethod override  \nExtending forms  \nExpose an API  \nSolution model\n\nAddon modules\nAn “addon” module is almost a stand-alone module in its own right in\nthat it contains fully encapsulated functionality. This functionality\nthough is considered an extension to the functionality of another\nmodule.\nSet addon modules to be “children” to the core module.\nAn example of this approach in action is the Sutra CMS modules.\n_dsa_mosaic_WEB_cms is the core functional Sutra CMS module and\n_dsa_mosaic_WEB_cms_blocks is an addon module. It contains all the\ncode for the CMS blocks that ship with the core product.\nLater on, we or anyone else could come up with addon modules for content\nworkflows, website traffic analysis, products and shopping cart, etc.\nThe commonality of these addon module examples is that they all extend\nthe functionality of the core CMS module with discrete functionality\nthat is best contained in modules of their own.\nAn easily overlooked issue that arises from this approach is what\nhappens when you need to access a global method or a relation or a value\nlist in the core module? You can’t include the core module in your addon\nmodule as this would create a circular reference.\nThe trick is to not put resources that could potentially be used in\naddon modules in the core functional module. Instead, put these\nresources in their own “addon” module, include this in the core\nfunctional module, and include as you need in other addon modules.\nAgain from Sutra CMS, note the _dsa_mosaic_CMS_resources module. It\ncontains all the globals, value lists, relations, and calculations used\nin Sutra CMS and it is included in both the core module and the blocks\naddon module.\n\nTo build your own CMS addon module, just include the CMS resources\nmodule and start coding.\nThis approach is recommended for all major core functional modules that\nyou build such as a CRM, project management, document management, etc.\nIt gives you the flexibility to write core functionality in a main\nmodule and layer on sets of functionality with other modules over time.\nSee “SVN considerations” below if you have your code under SVN.\nMethod override\nOn the other side of the spectrum from addon module is the method\noverride technique. It is a targeted one-shot way to override a default\nmethod.\nThis technique is simple in its direct approach. Run a method from\nanywhere in your solution if it exists or run a default method in this\nmodule if not:\n    //check for INVx method\n    if (globals.CODE_servoy_object_exists(\"IMAGE_import\", \"INVx_0C__file_stream\")) {\n        forms.INVx_0C__file_stream.IMAGE_import(path,1)\n    }\n    //run default file streaming method\n    else {\n        forms.INV_0C__file_stream.IMAGE_import(path)\n    }\n\nThis is the code we use to check if a method exists:\n    function CODE_servoy_object_exists(methodName, formName) {\n        //a method passed in to check\n        if (methodName) {\n            //a form specified\n            if (formName) {\n                var smForm = solutionModel.getForm(formName)\n\n                //check to see if form exists\n                if (smForm) {\n\n                    //check for method existence on given form\n                    if (smForm.getFormMethod(methodName)) {\n                        return true\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        return false\n                    }\n                }\n                else {\n                    return false\n                }\n            }\n            //no form specified, at the global scope\n            else {\n                //check for global method existence\n                if (solutionModel.getGlobalMethod(methodName)) {\n                    return true\n                }\n                else {\n                    return false\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            return false\n        }\n    }\n\nThis approach is easiest way to allow a small number of methods to be extended by a method somewhere else in your solution.\nExtending forms\nSomewhere in between the addon module and method override techniques is\nthe extending forms technique. This approach allows you to customize\nuser interfaces and override functionality on a form-by-form basis.\n\nNote: future self is no longer a fan of extending forms. It introduces tight-coupling which is almost always not a good idea. In fact, the example given here were the only time we used extended forms and it turned out to be hard to debug and changing code was a fearful process. Typical of tight coupling.\n\nBasics\nThe key to this approach is Servoy’s cool feature that allows a form to\nextend another form (form inheritance. When you extend a form, your\nnew form retains all the methods and design elements of the extended\nform. In addition to creating new methods and UI elements, you can\noverride the original methods and UI element properties (but not delete\ninherited UI elements).\nTo extend the functionality of a core module, in another module (ie,\ncustom client module), extend whatever forms you need and present those\nforms instead of the original forms to your user.\nUI\nSince extending forms doesn’t allow you to delete inherited UI\nelements—separating logic from UI in the original module adds additional\nUI flexibility down the line.\nTypically you create a form and add methods and UI elements to it. To\nseparate logic from UI, first create a form for just methods. Set the UI\nto contain no parts and a width of zero. Then create a new form that\nextends this form and create your UI on the new form.\nIn this screen shot note the WLOGIN_0W_login__account_template form\nwhich contains the UI and extends the WLOGIN_0W_login__account form\nwhich contains the methods:\n\nTo override the default UI, extend the “UI” form of the core module to\nstart with both the original functionality and UI. This works best if\nyou are reskinning the original UI or just adding new UI elements.\nFor ultimate UI flexibility, extend the “method” form of the core module\nto get a blank form with all original functionality as your starting\npoint. To this you can copy UI elements from the original “UI” form to\nkick start your new UI work.\nHere’s a screen shot of showing how we’ve “overridden” the UI of the\nprevious screen shot using this technique:\n\nExpose an API\nYou can expose business logic via [Servoy’s RESTful web services]\nplugin. Exposing functionality this way is essentially an API for 3rd\nparty applications to use. API’s can also be called by other modules\nwithin your solution.\nWhile an API is technically more of a way to interface with a core\nmodule’s functionality, calling an API method and then doing something\nmore with the results can be considered a way of “extending” core\nfunctionality.\nSolution model\nAll of the techniques listed so far are design-time approaches. With\nServoy’s solution model, you can create anything you want at run-time.\nThis approach gives you the most flexibility but writing UI’s entirely\nin code also disconnects you from the visual design process.\nFor this reason, meta data is often used to drive solution model code.\nOne source of meta data is design-time forms and methods. Grabbing a\ndesign-time form, tweaking a bit, then writing back out to the user—is a\nquick and easy way to use solution model code painlessly and\neffectively.\nSummary\nThere are a number of techniques for creating reusable modules and\nextending their functionality. If taken into consideration when\ndesigning your modules, they can greatly enhance module usefulness.\nMulti-developer Considerations\nThe well known reason for putting your code under version control is\nenabling multiple developers to collaborate on code easier.\nAn additional key benefit: SVN combined with reusable modules allows you\nto share and modify core code across multiple client projects.\nTo make this last goal work smoothly there are two things you need to\ntake into account: how to include modules and managing Servoy Developer\nresource projects.\nIncluding modules\nWhen you include a module in another module, this modifies a file in the\nparent module—not the child module. If the parent module is a core\nfunctional module that you are using across multiple client projects,\neach of those client projects will see that other client-specific\nchange.\nServoy references child modules by name, not UUID (a rare instance where\nthis happens instead of the other way around). We can utilitize this\nfact to come up with a solution.\nFor core functional modules that you expect to be reused and extended by\nmultiple client projects, create a “connector” module whose only\nfunction is to allow modules to be added to the core module without all\nyour of your developer environments noting this change via SVN.\nTo use, include this connector module into your core functional module\nand commit up to your SVN repository.\nIn another developer instance, check out the core and connector modules\ninto your workspace. Then disconnect SVN sharing for the connector\nmodule while keeping sharing on for the core module.\nInclude any modules that you use for that client project to extend a\ncore functional module in the connector module. Other developer\nenvironments will not see this file change as the connector module is\ndisconnected from SVN across all the developer environments.\nTo use Sutra CMS as an example again, notice that the CMS currently\ncomprises of four modules—one of which is a connector module:\n\nThis allows us to add client-specific website modules to the CMS\nconnector module without triggering a file change in the CMS repository.\n\nManaging resource projects\nFor each Servoy Developer workspace there is a special project called\n“resources” which is where Servoy stores information for database\nservers, styles, security, templates, and repository settings:\n\nThis resources project is stored in the workspace and by default applies\nto all of the modules in your active solution. While it is possible to\nchange this resources project on a module-by-module basis this doesn’t\nwork when you have a solution with core functional modules coming from\ndifferent SVN repositories—each with their own resources.\nThe solution is to create an eclipse project for each core functional\nmodule to store its unique resources. Put this project under SVN\ncontrol. Then combine all of these eclipse “resource” projects for the\nvarious core functional modules you are using in a solution into your\nlocal default resources project.\nThis process requires a bit of hands-on management which is best done in\nthe Eclipse project explorer view:\n\nNote the shared eclipse resource projects specific to various reusable\nmodules and the unshared Servoy resources project.\nFollowing an update, copy changed files from the shared eclipse resource\nprojects into the unshared Servoy resource project. While coding, if you\nchange a resource of a core functional module (ie, add a column to a CMS\ntable), manually copy the changed file from the unshared Servoy resource\nproject to the correct shared module’s eclipse resource project and then\ncommit.\nThis commit will then show for all other shared developer environments.\nThey will then need to go through the update and copy to the unshared\nServoy resource projects steps.\nNow this may sound like a handful and it is the first few times you set\nit up, but with practice it comes naturally and allows you to reuse and\nshare modules and their associated resources across many client\nprojects.\n\n(Note: if you don’t see some of your specific resource project folders,\n“Deselect Working Set” is available in the menu triggered by the small\ndownward-pointing triangle button.)\nSummary\nServoy’s module feature allows for many creative options when\narchitecting large applications. Not only do they help you keep your\ncode organized, with a little forethought and planning you can write\nreusable modules that can be used in many applications and\nprojects—while keeping their ability to be maintained and upgraded\nintact.\n"},"developer-guide/api.html":{"url":"developer-guide/api.html","title":"API","keywords":"","body":"API\n\n\nUsage notes\nReference\nDS.session\nDS.print\nDS.transaction\n\n\n\n\nThe Data Sutra API provides high level code helper functions, triggers\nfor UI actions, and meta data handling.\nUsage notes\n\nThe Data Sutra API is documented using the latest JSDocs.

Once your reports are\nregistered, they can be assigned to the reports action button in the\nnavigation engine.\nDedicated reporting module\nWe recommend that you create a module dedicated to reports for your\nparticular solution and/or client. This keeps your report code in one\nplace and separated out from all of your other business logic. As you\nwill see in the following sections, wiring in reports from your module\nto various places in the UI is easily done with Data Sutra configuration\npanes.\nConfiguration pane: Report registry\nEach record represents a report and has options about where the report\nis coming from and how it should be run.\nIf your report is based on a Servoy form, choose the module and form.\n\nIf you specify a method, that method is run when the user chooses\nthe report. You are responsible for calling our API to preview or\ndownload the report in your method. This approach allows for\ncomplex reporting logic.\nIf you don’t specify a method, we apply a default printing action to\nthe specified form and show it in our pdf previewer.

If no method, our wrapper will\nautomatically show the URL in our pdf previewer.\nLastly, the key column is there so you can reference a registered\nreport with the scopes.DS.print.trigger(key) api method. This enables\nyou to run a report from within your own business logic.\nAssigning reports into the UI\nThere are two places where reports can be triggered from: from our\nreports action button or your business code.\nConfiguring reports action button\nOnce a report is registered, it is available to be assigned to any\nreports action button. Reports action buttons are accessed in the\nNavigation engine configuration pane, then Actions tab, then\nReports tab.\nClick the checkbox on the Reports tab to turn the reports action\nbutton on.\nThe configuration pane shows a list of registered reports and a list of\nreports assigned. Move items from the registered reports list to the\nreports assigned list and enter a label name that will be displayed in\nthe popup menu for that report.\n\nTriggering a report from your code\nUse trigger(key) api method to run any registered report from within\nyour own business logic. This method will run the report with all the\noptions specified in the report registry.\nReporting approaches\n\nCopied from Scott Buttler’s Servoy forum post:\nhttps://www.servoy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=19350\\#p104122\n\nBuilt-in\nYou can build Servoy Forms using Title Headers, Headers, Footers,\nSummary, etc and build a report.

Relations and calculations will convert your uppercase letters to lowercase, most special characters are not valid, etc. A useful quirk is that form events and properties automatically match to a method of the same name. Another Servoy quirk is how to name methods for JUnit testing. Then there is JavaDoc to learn....\n6 Know your SQL vendor naming restrictions\nIt's not just Servoy that you have to worry about, SQL vendors may have their own unique naming restrictions. It helps then to match up your Servoy naming conventions to your SQL vendor.\n7 Size matters, but not to Servoy\nServoy doesn't have any length restrictions but quite often databases do.\n8 Use what naming style is comfortable to you and your team\nAs programmers, we have all used many different naming styles over the years. Some are more comfortable to us than others.\n9 Employing different naming styles for different types of objects can help your frame of reference\nSince there are so many types of objects, using different naming styles can be a useful to delineator. For example, we use underscore style for most things but use camelCase for method variable names.\n10 Module and form names benefit greatly from very descriptive names that add additional layers of organization\nThis last consideration is consideration #3 on steroids. There are a couple of Servoy objects (specifically: modules and forms) where being VERY descriptive can go a long ways in organizing your solution and workflow. For example, our module names sandbox modules into several categories and contain a unique identifier that is used as a prefix for many of the named object in the module. And our forms are named so that \"formsets\" are grouped together in the Solution Explorer. \nData Sutra style overview\nUPPERCASE\nCode\nUppercase VARIABLES are used for specifying constant values. While not enforced, values should never be changed after initialization and are considered immutable.\nModule namespacing\nA short uppercase abbreviation is used in the second slot of module names to denote the namespace of a module.\nWith Data Sutra based solutions easily reaching 20+ modules — all of which get combined into one global namespace for an entire solution — this module identifer is key to keeping contained objects \"scoped\" to their module.\nScopes\nModule scopes start their names with a unique string in uppercase. Resource modules usually have a dedicated scope with the same identifier as the module container the core API of that module.\n\nlowercase\nThe only time this style happens is when using camelCase for variables and not needing a second \"word\" in the name. Sometimes you'll see a form object with just a single lowercase name but that is mistake/laziness where we forgot to add the type prefix to the form object name.\nunder_score\nThis style is used so commonly it can be practically considered our default style. If we're not using one of the other styles, we're using the under_score style.\ncamelCase\nWe use this for method variable names.\ncUs3om (custom)\nWe use very specific and customized naming styles for two objects -- modules and forms -- to add important layers of organization.\nModules are grouped into three main functional areas (Data Sutra, addons, business); can be split further into types (head, resource); and contain a unique identifier that is used as a prefix for naming objects within the module.\nForms are named by a formula that groups all forms used in a formset together into a hierarchical \"bundle\". This models how we develop our screens -- some of our screen design patterns comprise of 20+ forms. Having them together in one block with the \"head\" form at the top saves us loads of time and frustration.\nNaming conventions by Servoy object\n1 Modules\n\nFormat\ncategory _ unique identifier _ readable name\n\n\nExamples\n_ds_NAV_engine\n_dsa_mosaic_WEB_cms\n_dsa_mosaic_WEB_cms_blocks\nstrato_SPHERE_game_manager\n\n\n\nCategory\n\n_ds is used for core Data Sutra modules\n_dsa is used for Data Sutra application modules\nclientID is used for Client application modules\n\nUnique identifier (CAPS)\nThis identifier is used to prefix most of a modules' objects so that they are uniquely named when combined with other modules.\nThere are cases where we use the same identifier for more than one module when those modules have strong coupling. Uniqueness accross these modules is usually handled with a sub prefix or just careful naming.\nReadable name\nFinally, it helps if a module name has a descriptive section.\n2 Database connections\n\nFormat\nclientID _ descriptive name\n\n\nExamples\nsutra, sutra_example, sutra_log\nsutra_cms, mosaic_solutions\ndata_linds, strato_game_data\n\n\n\nData Sutra requires the first three database connections listed. All other database connections are assumed to be data buckets for various application modules.\nConvention is to name these data buckets either after a client or an application.\n3 Databases, tables and columns\nDatabases are organized per sizeable chunks of functionality and are named accordingly. Additionally, there is often a prefix to associate a database with a client. \n\nlinds_sutra\nlinds_sutra_cms\nlinds_mosaic_solutions\n\nTables are named per logical data bucket and can have a prefix to namespace the tables. Where multiple tables are used to store a functionality grouping, one or more grouping names are used as prefixes.\n\nsutra_access_action\nsutra_access_filter\nsutra_access_group\nsutra_access_group_action\n\nColumns follow a similar pattern to table names. Some common grouping prefixes are date_, id_ and rec_.\n\nNote: prefixes are never put at the end of a name. For example 'tablename_id' should be 'id_tablename', even for foreign keys\n\n\n4 Forms\n\nFormat\nmodule prefix\nREPEAT for each \"depth\" form is located\nlevel -- 0 to 9 for depth, R for reusable, P for dialogues\ntype -- F for form, L for list, T for table\nopt unique form set identifier\ntable name (opt on repeat if table name is the same as leve prior)\ntask (opt)\n\n\nEND REPEAT\n\n\n\nForms compose together in Servoy via tab panels to create complete UI's. Even simple UI's typically have several contained forms.\nThis situation is increased additively as multiple forms are assigned to tab panels and multiplicatively as forms contain forms that contain even more forms that contain forms ... etc.\nWe call a set of forms that make up one discreet UI a form stack.\nIn the following screen shots you can see a form stack comprised of seven forms:\n\nWEB_0F_asset contains WEB_0F_asset_1F in the first tab panel and forms WEB_0F_1F__tags and WEB_0F 1L_page in a second tab panel.\n\nWEB_0F_asset_1F contains WEB_0F_asset_1F_2L_asset_instance and WEB_0F_asset_1F_2L_asset_instance_meta in tab panels in a splitter.\nThe result:\n\nThe naming convention for forms models the composable nature of Servoy forms while keeping them in order alphabetically in the Solution Explorer pane.\nA more extreme example:\n\n\n5 Form elements\n\nNote: form elements need not be named unless they are used in scripting\n\n\nFormat\nfld_ ...\nbtn_ ...\ntab_ ...\nbean_ ...\nhelp_ ... -- special help button\ngfx_ ...\nlbl_ ...\n\n\n\n\n6 Relations\n\nFormat\nMODULEPREFIX _ standard_name __ unique_task\n\n\n\n\n7 Calculations\nSame as column names.\n\n8 Value lists\n\nFormat\nMODULEPREFIX _ GROUPING _ functional label\n\n\n\n\n9 Methods\n\nFormat\nACTIONTYPE _ action\n\n\nAction types\nFORM, REC, FILTER, FLD, FX, TAB, etc\n\n\n\n\n10 Variables\n\ncamelCase for non-constant variables\nUPPERCASE for immutable constants\n\n11 Global variables and form variables\nSame as variable naming except with the addition of global identifier prefix for global variables and a form prefix for form variables.\n"},"developer-guide/bootstrap-hooks.html":{"url":"developer-guide/bootstrap-hooks.html","title":"Bootstrap Hooks","keywords":"","body":"Bootstrap Hooks\nSetting up and tearing down your application can be customized with your\nown methods in several spots.

Second,\nServoy is not a database.\nDepending on your previous experience, either one or both of these facts\nmay be different than what you are used to.\nResources\nWe have a number of useful coding related videos posted here:\n\nServoy essentials on YouTube\n\nImportant Servoy links:.\n\nServoy’s quick start guide\nServoy forum\n\nRAD tool and deployment platform\nFrom the Servoy Quickstart Guide:\n\nServoy is unique in that it is both a Rapid Application Development\n(RAD) tool and a production deployment platform.\n\nThis matters because installation is different for developer and\ndeployment machines. The Servoy developer component is based on Eclipse\nand is a stand-alone IDE with an integrated server for debugging. The\nServoy server component is typically installed as a headless process and\ncomes with a browser-based administration interface.\nRunning Servoy Developer and Servoy Server on the same machine at the\nsame time is only possible if you change the port number for one of the\ninstances (default is 8080). Generally, it is not recommended to have\nboth on the same machine just because that would be really weird for a\nwhole bunch of IT deployment and development workflow related reasons.\nOne of which would be that at no time do you develop on a “live”\napplication. Instead, you write code in Servoy Developer, export your\nsolution to a file, and then import this file into Servoy Server via the\nadministration interface.\nIf you catch an error after importing to the live production\nenvironment, Servoy Server has a really cool feature that allows you to\nrollback the deployed application to any previously uploaded version of\nthe application.\nInstalling Servoy Server can be a bit involved and is beyond the scope\nof this document. When you download and install Servoy for the first\ntime, it will most likely be for the reason of setting up the Servoy\ndeveloper component. And this process is about as easy as an\ninstallation can be so no need to elaborate further here. Except to note\nthat…\nServoy is not a database\nWhoa…what?!? Again, from the quickstart guide:\n\nServoy is NOT a database. There are plenty great databases out there and Servoy can connect any modern RDBMS (and even some that aren’t so modern).\n\nThe confusion here is twofold:\n\nServoy ships with PostgreSQL\nMost Servoy applications you develop use a database\n\nHaving PostgreSQL bundled into your developer install is really\nconvenient for your first foray into Servoy development as it is just\none less thing you have to think about. A drawback to this setup is that\nthe PostgreSQL database engine starts up and shuts down as you open and\nclose Servoy Developer. It also runs on the default PostgreSQL ports so\nif you already have PostgreSQL running, the Servoy install of PostgreSQL\nwon’t start up at all.\nThe key to all this is to recognize that Servoy allows you to connect to\nany database you want. We basically never install the default database\nnowadays when installing Servoy but instead [connect to RDBMS’s] already\ninstalled on our machines (developer and server) after we have installed\nServoy. This allows us to manage the database layer in one place no\nmatter how many various development environments and client projects\nwe’re juggling at any given time.\nWe primarily test against MySQL and occasionally PostgreSQL No\nrecommendation implied here—just the way we roll. In Sutra CMS we have\navoided using non-standard SQL queries and unique database features so\nfeel free to use with the RDMS of your choice.
