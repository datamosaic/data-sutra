# Printing Labels with Avery


Printing labels out of Servoy — whether using default printing, or
Velocity Reports, or Jasper Reports — can be a time consuming and very
non-programmer-ish process. Not the type of thing I like spending my day
on.

So…instead of doing all the work yourself, make the client do it. With
Avery online labels:
